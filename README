PGObject-Type-JSON

This module is a type handler for JSON entities.  This is a best effort mapping
of types to references.  Literal values are handled as literal references.

The current limitation is that there is no ability to distinguish between a 
database NULL and a json value of null which can be distinct in PostgreSQL.  
Such support is planned for 1.0.
